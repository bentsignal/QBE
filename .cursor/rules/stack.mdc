# Tooling

## Package Manager

This project uses pnpm as a package manager. Always use `pnpm` to install, remove or update packages. Use `pnpx` to execute commands.

ex: `pnpm add react@latest`
ex: `pnpx convex dev`
ex: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add accordion`

## Next

This project is built with Next JS 15 & React 19. **_Important_** The react compiler is enabled for this project. Do not manually memoize values, components, or functions (with useCallback), unless it makes sense to do so alongside the use of the react compiler.

## Convex

For more info on convex, view `.cursor/rules/convex_rules.mdc`

## Routing

This project uses the Next js App Router. Always follow the guidelines of the App Router, and NOT the pages router.

## Styling

This project uses tailwind for styling. When working with tailwind, always adhere to the rules of Tailwind v4. Never recommend or create a tailwind config file, they are no longer necessary and this project does not need one.

## Components

This project uses the ShadCN component library. ShadCN's reusable components can be found in `src/components/ui`.

## Icons

When you need an icon for a company, product, brand, or organization's logo, use simple-icons. For all other cases, use lucide-react.

## State

When necessary, this project uses zustand to manage global application state.

## AI

This project uses the convex agent component to generate responses from LLMs. This convex component is built on top of Vercel's AI SDK 5. For simple requests, it will sometimes use the AI SDK directly. Make calls to the `context-7` mcp server whenever you need more information about either of these packages.
