# Tooling

## Styling
This project uses tailwind v4. When working with tailwind, always adhere to the rules of v4. Never recommend or create a tailwind config file.

## Components
This project uses the shadcn component library. ShadCN's reusable components can be found in src/components/ui. Use these files at will to create new UI, but never make changes to the shadcn components directly. 

## Icons
For most cases, use lucide-react for icons. When you need an icon for a brand or product logo, use simple-icons
