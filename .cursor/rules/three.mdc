This project offers certain features in AR/VR using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/xr`. It uses `@react-three/uikit` and `@react-three/uikit-default` as a component library for the 3d scenes, and `@react-three/uikit-lucide` to get lucide icons in 3d scenes. 


If you ever run into issues involving these packages, use the context-7 mcp to gather context from their documentation.
